# Solution for leetcode problems
This project is a set of solutions from leetcode. 

Problems are split into a folder by language used:
- JavaScript - VSCode is used to build and debug. All files are located in the same folder named by the task name and problem number.
- Scala - IntelliJ IDEA is my tool of choice. Problems split into packages with similar name_problem number pattern. Each solution is in its own package to make it easier to run and debug
in IntelliJ IDEA that I use as my main IDE.
